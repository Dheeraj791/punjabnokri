    </p>

    <p>
        1. The Service. The HYRSKILLS service provides a platform that enables registered users who are looking for
        employment opportunities or contract opportunities (each, a “Seeker”) to find and connect with providers of such
        employment or contracting opportunities (each, a “Business”) through the Website and/or App (the “Service”). In
        order to access the Service, you must register for an account and pay the applicable subscription fees.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Disclaimer: HYRSKILLS does not take part in, nor is HYRSKILLS in any way responsible for, any interactions
        between Seekers and Businesses, except to the extent necessary to maintain our Services. Any interaction between
        you
        and any other individual or entity through our Services or arising out of your use of our Services, including
        any
        interactions between Businesses and Seekers, is solely between you and that other individual or entity.
        HYRSKILLS
        expressly disclaims any responsibility for any interactions between Seekers and Businesses. For avoidance of
        doubt,
        HYRSKILLS disclaims any responsibility for any employment or contracting opportunities, employment or
        contracting
        services, or any other services or products acquired or made available through our Services, even if HYRSKILLS
        investigates or attempts to verify any information in connection therewith. You agree that you must evaluate and
        bear all risks associated with the use of our Services, including the Services Materials and the User Content,
        and
        that you may not rely on the Services Materials or User Content.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Registration. In order to access certain content, services, products or benefits on our Services, you will be
        asked to register and create an account. By registering an account on our Services, you represent that you are
        16
        years of age or older. Depending on your intended uses of our Services, you may be asked to designate your
        account
        as either a Seeker Account (i.e., for an Employment Seeker) or a Business Account (i.e., for a Business). Your
        obligations and rights under these Terms may vary depending on whether you registered as a Seeker or a Business.
        Also as part of the registration process, you may be asked to select a username and password, and may be
        required to
        provide HYRSKILLS with certain information about yourself, including some types of personally identifying
        information such as your email and postal addresses, your telephone number and your employment
        experiences/skills.
        You agree that the information that you provide to us on registration and at all other times will be true,
        accurate,
        current and complete. You also agree that you will ensure that this information is kept accurate and up to date
        at
        all times. Any information that you provide to HYRSKILLS through our Services or email is subject to HYRSKILLS’s
        Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference as if set forth fully herein.
    </p>
    <p>
        As part of the registration process, you will be asked to select a user name and password. Only you are
        permitted to
        access our Services, the Services Materials, and the User Content through your account. Without limiting the
        foregoing, you are fully responsible for your account, including use of the account by any third party, and
        maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You may suspend your account at any time by suspending the
        account
        within your profile or by emailing support@hyrskills.com.
        By registering, you are subscribing to transactional notification emails and/or text messages related to the
        Services (including notifications that will inform you when a job that matches your profile is posted). You can
        unsubscribe or manage your notification frequency settings at any time by logging into your account and changing
        your notification settings or by using any of the other methods described in the Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. Verification. By registering with our Services, you hereby authorize HYRSKILLS to verify any representations
        and
        warranties you make either pursuant to these Terms or within any materials submitted during the registration
        process, including conducting background checks, contacting any provided references, and reviewing public
        records.
        You acknowledge that while HYRSKILLS reserves the right to verify these representations and warranties,
        HYRSKILLS is
        not obligated to do so, and may choose not to do so, at HYRSKILLS’s sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Listing Employment or Contracting Opportunities. Upon registration, a Business may submit, through our
        Services,
        a notification to Seekers of a potential employment or contracting opportunity (a “Job Posting”). A Job Posting
        may
        only notify Seekers of a single employment or contracting opportunity, and must include, at a minimum, the
        following
        information: start date, position title, job description, availability requirements and skill requirements. Upon
        submission of a Job Posting, the submitting Business may fix typographical errors within the Job Posting, but
        may
        not make any substantial changes to the Job Posting. HYRSKILLS may also fix typographical errors within the Job
        Posting, but is not obligated to.
    </p>
    <p>
        You agree not to use our Services to promote or further the commercial activities, including by submitting a Job
        Posting in connection with those activities, of any of the businesses, activities, or practices set forth in
        HYRSKILLS’s list of Prohibited Business, as incorporated into these Terms by reference as if set forth fully
        herein.
        For avoidance of doubt, each Job Posting must comply with all restrictions hereunder, including those governing
        the
        submission of User Content and general use of our Services. HYRSKILLS may, but is not obligated to, make an
        independent investigation of the Job Posting to ensure full compliance with these Terms. If HYRSKILLS
        determines, in
        its sole discretion, that any representation or warranty made by you pursuant to these Terms is in any way
        false,
        incomplete, or inaccurate, HYRSKILLS may, at any time, reject, remove, or suspend or delay the posting of your
        Job
        Posting, in whole or in part. HYRSKILLS may, but is not obligated to, provide you with an explanation for the
        rejection or removal of any of your Job Postings from our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        All jobs posted on HYRSKILLS may be transferred into a publicly-viewable job listing page. These pages are
        indexed
        to various third parties, and are not taken down after being filled; however, the job page will not accept
        applicants once a listing is closed (and the page will act as informational only, with links bringing a user
        back to
        the HYRSKILLS default homepages.)
    </p>
    <p>
        6. Privacy. It is important that you read and understand the Privacy Policy, especially because the nature of
        the
        Services necessarily involve the collection and use of personally identifiable information and other personal
        data
        (‘Personal Data’). The most current Privacy Policy will apply to any and all use of the Services. HYRSKILLS will
        not
        intentionally edit, modify, delete or disclose the contents of your Personal Data in connection with the
        Services
        except (a) as reasonably necessary for HYRSKILLS (or its service providers) to provide the Services, including
        processing and responding to your inputs, (b) to communicate with you, (c) as otherwise permitted under the
        Privacy
        Policy or elsewhere in these Terms, (d) when HYRSKILLS reasonably believes that such action is necessary to
        conform
        or comply with any legal, regulatory, law enforcement or similar requirement or investigation, to protect or
        defend
        the rights or property of HYRSKILLS or any third party or to enforce the Terms or (e) as otherwise authorized by
        you.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. Payment. Some of our Services will be available for purchase. You are responsible for all charges incurred
        under
        your account, whether made by you or another person using your account. If for any reason HYRSKILLS does not
        receive
        payment for a purchase, HYRSKILLS may exercise its rights in law and equity, including (a) immediately
        suspending or
        terminating your account; (b) seeking collection of the outstanding amount owed; and/or (c) seeking legal action
        against you for the breach of these Terms. You are also responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed in
        connection with use or purchase of any of our Services, including sales, use, and excise taxes (excluding only
        taxes
        on HYRSKILLS’s net income). To the extent that HYRSKILLS is obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax
        will
        be added to your billing account. All sales are final. HYRSKILLS is not responsible for any costs or expenses in
        connection with any interactions between Seekers and Businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
        8. Proprietary Rights. Unless HYRSKILLS explicitly states otherwise in an agreement between you and HYRSKILLS,
        as
        between you and HYRSKILLS, HYRSKILLS owns or licenses and retains all rights, title and interests in and to all
        Apps, data, content, graphics, forms, artwork, images, photographs, functional components and any software
        concepts
        and documentation and other material on, in or made available through our Services (“Services Materials”), as
        well
        as the selection, coordination, arrangement, and organization and enhancement of the Services Materials. All
        Services Materials are protected pursuant to copyright, trademark, patent and other applicable laws. As between
        any
        user of the Services and HYRSKILLS, all names, trademarks, service marks, certification marks, symbols, slogans
        or
        logos appearing on the Services are proprietary to HYRSKILLS or its affiliates, licensors (including
        Businesses), or
        suppliers. Use or misuse of these trademarks is expressly prohibited and may violate trademark laws. Under no
        circumstances will you have any rights of any kind in or to the Services Materials, other than the right to use
        the
        Services Materials in accordance with these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the
        content
        you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are
        otherwise
        permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certain features of the Services (including the registration processes described in Section 3 above) may allow
        you
        to contribute comments, feedback, information, content, text, files, trademarks, logos, graphics, postings, and
        other materials and information, including Job Postings, for access, use, viewing and commentary by other users
        to
        the Services (“User Content”). By posting User Content, you represent that you have the full legal right to
        provide
        the User Content and that use of the User Content by our Services and all other persons and entities will not:
        (a)
        infringe any intellectual property rights of any person or entity or any rights of publicity, personality, or
        privacy of any person or entity, including as a result of your failure to obtain consent to post personally
        identifying or otherwise private information about a person; (b) violate any law, statute, ordinance,
        regulation, or
        agreement; (c) be defamatory, libelous or trade libelous, unlawfully threatening, or unlawfully harassing; (d)

        community or Internet standard; (g) constitute misappropriation of any trade secret or know-how; or (h)
        constitute

    </p>
    <p>
        You retain all right, title and interest in and to the User Content that you submit and all intellectual
        property
        rights embodied therein. Upon your submission of User Content or other material or information to HYRSKILLS, you
        grant HYRSKILLS a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, license to access, use, distribute,
        reproduce,
        display, modify, host, communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly distribute, and create derivative works
        based upon, and sublicense, the User Content, all without any compensation to you whatsoever. This license
        continues
        even if you stop using our Services. If you believe that any content or postings on our Services or the
        Application
        violate your intellectual property or other rights, please follow our Complaint Procedure within these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        9. Unauthorized Activities. You agree that you will not use our Services for: (a) any illegal or unauthorized
        purposes that violate any local, national, or international laws (including but not limited to import, export,

        has requested not to be contacted; (c) stalking or harassing anyone; (d) data mining, scraping, or for releasing

        by
        general purpose public search engines; (e) promoting any effort to compete with HYRSKILLS, including using our
        Services to provide, alone or in combination with any other product or service, any service to any third party
        or
        any use that causes a reduction or loss of business for HYRSKILLS as related to an existing or potential
        customer;
        (f) modifying, copying, distributing, displaying, performing, reproducing, publishing, licensing, creating
        derivative works from, transferring, selling any of our Services Materials, unless otherwise authorized by these
        Terms or in a separate written agreement with HYRSKILLS; (g) attempting to gain unauthorized access to

        Services
        Materials consistently with these Terms. A Business may use our Services to create and maintain a culture of
        workplace diversity and inclusion and it may not use our Services to unlawfully discriminate against any Seeker.

        other use of our Services or Services Materials, including but not limited to the aforementioned unauthorized
        uses,
        without prior written permission of HYRSKILLS is strictly prohibited. You acknowledge and agree that the
        unauthorized use of our Services or the Services Materials could cause irreparable harm to HYRSKILLS and that in
        the
        event of such unauthorized use, HYRSKILLS shall be entitled to an injunction in addition to any other remedies
        available at law or in equity.
    </p>
    <p>
        10. Third Party Web Sites and Content. Our Services are available for informational purposes only. Our Services
        may
        contain links to other Internet Web sites for the convenience of users in locating information, products, or
        services that may be of interest that are not owned or controlled by HYRSKILLS. Our Services may also
        incorporate
        features and services provided by third parties, such as payment processing. Use of such third party links,
        features, and services, our Services and the Services Materials, and any other material or content on and made
        available through our Services is entirely at your own risk. HYRSKILLS does not recommend and expressly
        disclaims
        any responsibility for the content, the accuracy of the information, or quality of products or services provided
        by
        or advertised on third party sites or the transactions you conduct or enter into with third parties. Your use of
        any
        third party’s website is at your own risk, and subject to the terms and conditions of such other websites,
        including
        the terms and conditions of HYRSKILLS’s third party payment processors. HYRSKILLS does not endorse any product,
        service, or treatment provided on a third party website or advertised or provided on our Services.
        While HYRSKILLS does not prohibit linking to third party websites and content, it does not wish to be linked to
        or
        from any third-party website which contains, posts or transmits any of the prohibited content in these Terms of
        Use.
        HYRSKILLS reserves the right to prohibit or remove (or require You to remove) any link to the Website or App,
        including, without limitation, any link which contains or makes available any content or information of the
        foregoing nature, at any time.
        11. Availability of the Services. HYRSKILLS uses reasonable efforts to ensure that our Services are generally
        available. However, there will be occasions when access to our Services will be interrupted or unavailable.
        HYRSKILLS will use reasonable efforts to minimize such disruption where it is within its reasonable control. You
        agree that HYRSKILLS shall not be liable for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of our Services and
        that all amounts paid under these Terms are non-refundable. In addition, HYRSKILLS may update, modify, suspend

        12. Disclaimer. The information on our Services is for informational purposes only. Without limiting anything
        else

        Services Materials. HYRSKILLS, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, are not responsible for and do not guarantee
        the
        accuracy or completeness of any Services Materials, User Content, products, data, services (whether performed by
        HYRSKILLS, any Seeker or Business, or any third party), links, advertisements, or other items contained within
        our
        Services. HYRSKILLS reserves the right to immediately remove any Services Materials or User Content for any
        reason
        or for no reason. HYRSKILLS cannot and does not review all communications or products made available on or
        through
        our Services, but, although not obligated to, may review, verify, make changes to or remove any User Content,
        Services Materials, the products or services made available in connection with our Services, including
        information
        submitted in connection with the Services Materials or other features at any time, with or without notice in its
        sole discretion.
        THE SERVICES MATERIALS, USER CONTENT, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, INFORMATION, AND OTHER MATERIALS ON, IN AND MADE
        AVAILABLE
        THROUGH OUR SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” USE OF OUR SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR

        SERVICES, IS WITH YOU.
    </p>
    <p>
        13. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. HYRSKILLS AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
        INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, EXTRA-CONTRACTUAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING
        LOST
        REVENUES OR LOST PROFITS, WHICH MAY OR DOES RESULT FROM THE USE OF, ACCESS TO, OR INABILITY TO USE THE USER
        CONTENT,
        THE SERVICES MATERIALS, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, DATA AND OTHER MATERIALS ON, IN AND MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR
        SERVICES,
        REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT YOU OR HYRSKILLS HAD BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OR PROBABILITY
        OF
        SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF THE REMEDIES OTHERWISE AVAILABLE FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. UNDER NO
        CIRCUMSTANCES
        WILL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF HYRSKILLS AND ITS LICENSORS TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY IN CONNECTION WITH,

        PRECEDING
        YEAR FOR USE OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. SOME PROVINCES OR STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF
        LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF
        ANY
        PART OF THIS LIMITATION ON LIABILITY IS FOUND TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THE TOTAL
        LIABILITY OF HYRSKILLS AND ITS LICENSORS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10). If you are dissatisfied with our
        Services or with any of these Terms, or feel HYRSKILLS has breached these Terms, your sole and exclusive remedy

        14. Indemnification. You shall indemnify HYRSKILLS and its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors
        and
        licensors (“HYRSKILLS Indemnitees”) against all claims, actions, suits, and other proceedings (each, a “Claim”)
        arising out of or incurred in connection with our Services and your use of our Services, the Services Materials
        or
