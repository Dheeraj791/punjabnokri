        Y Innovations Inc. operating as HyrSkills (“we”/”us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We make the
        website, https://hyrskills.com/ (the “Website”) and the HyrSkills application (the “App”) available together
        with our services as further described in our Terms of Use (the “Services”). This Privacy Policy describes how
        we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users through the Website and Services – it does not
        address or govern any information-gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected
        from the users (sometimes referred to as a “user,” "you" or "your") other than directly through or from our
        Services, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline
        means or media.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consent: By using the Website, App or our Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as
        described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not
        be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively collect Personal Information for the
        purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual. In other words, we don’t sell
        customer lists. You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time.
        However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Website, App and/or the
        Services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collection of Information: We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us
        to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your
        inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes and for service improvement. We
        will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on signing up for our Services or
        contacting us with questions or for further information and we will use it only for the purposes for which we
        have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you agree that we may
        disclose it to other third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two types of information may be collected through the Website, App and our Services: Personal Information and
        Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the
        following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is
        publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a
        directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further
        below).
        "Personal Information" is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address,
        credit card information, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the
        information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not
        to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some
        instances you may not be able to register to use the Website or be able to access and use the Website at all. In
        other instances, your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be
        able to use certain features of the Website. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website
        through registration processes; communications with you; information downloads; service use; locations, user
        support; and surveys.
        "Non-Personal Information" is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP
        Address), the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being
        used by visitors to the website. Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g.
        average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and
        average time spent on the Website is not considered Personal Information. Similarly, business contact
        information such as the name, title, business address, or telephone number of a business or professional person
        or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.
        Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as
        described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy
        Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of
        such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website. Such Non-Personal
        Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website. For example, our web servers
        may automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie
        when you choose to visit the Website.
    </p>

    • Statistics: We also collect statistics about use of the Website, App and Services. This information will be kept
    confidential, however, aggregate statistics that do not personally identify an individual will be kept by us and
    such aggregate statistics may be made available to other members or third parties.
    • System Logs & Cookies: Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website. A cookie is a
    feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. The
    Website uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this Website, such as how many users
    visit the Website, how long users spend viewing the Website, and what pages are viewed most often. This information
    is used to improve the content of the Website. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie.
    This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to take
    advantage of all the features of the Website. We do not link any of the information we use in cookies to any
    personally identifiable information submitted by you when you are on the Website. Your IP address is reported by
    your web browser whenever you visit a page on the Website. This information is recorded together with your
    registration information on our databases.
    • Advertisements: Advertisements appearing on the Website may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web
    advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertisement server
    operated by that third party to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement.
    Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements
    and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements
    that they believe will be of most interest to you. The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by
    us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers. For the privacy practices of such
    third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web
    advertiser(s). It is solely your obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these
    other websites, advertisers and any third parties.

    <p>
        If we plan to use your Personal Information in future for any other purposes not identified above, we will only
        do so after informing you by updating this Privacy Policy. See further the section of this Privacy Policy
        entitled ‘Amendment of this Policy’.
        Disclosures & Transfers: We have put in place contractual and other organizational safeguards with our agents
        (see further below) to ensure a proper level of protection of your Personal Information (see further Security
        below). In addition to those measures, we will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third
        parties without your permission, except as specified in this Privacy Policy (see further Important Exceptions
        below).
    </p>
    <p>
        As at the date of this Privacy Policy, we share Personal Information about you in respect of the Website only
        with our service providers which include our cloud service provider, website host, payment processors, analytics
        providers, mapping service providers and email marketing provider. Our service providers store data worldwide
        and accordingly your Personal Information may be available to governments or agencies worldwide under a lawful
        order, irrespective of the safeguards we have put in place for the protection of your Personal Information.
        From time to time we may employ third parties to help us improve the Website, App and/or the Services. These
        third parties may have limited access to databases of user information solely for the purpose of helping us to
        improve the Website, App and/or the Services and they will be subject to contractual restrictions prohibiting
        them from using the information about our members for any other purpose.
        Important Exceptions: We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent if we have
        reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
        against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our
        rights or property, other Website or App members, other users of the Services, or anyone else (including the
        rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information
        when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law.
        We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or
        amalgamation with another entity, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any
        due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues to
        be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.
        Security: The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts
        to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment. We take technical, contractual,
        administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We
        have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such
        designated staff as are reasonably necessary to carry out the stated purposes we have communicated to you.
        In certain areas, such as when you provide credit card or other payment information to us, the Website works to
        help protect the security of your credit card and other payment information during transmission by using
        industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never
        give out your email account information or your password for the Services to third parties.
        Please be advised that the security and confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted through the
        Internet or any wireless network, including via our Services, email or text messages, cannot be and is not
        guaranteed. You acknowledge that the technical processing and transmission of our Services’ content may be
        transferred unencrypted and may involve: (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and
        adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. Accordingly, HyrSkills is not responsible for
        the security of information transmitted via the Internet or any wireless network.
        Retention: We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose
        or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain
        certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as
        analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained
        personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you request that your name be
        removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to
        technological and legal constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Amendment of this Policy: We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change
        this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post an appropriate notice on the home page, www.hyrskills.com. Any
        non-material change (such as clarifications) to this Privacy Policy will become effective on the date the change
        is posted and any material changes will become effective 30 days from their posting on the Website. Unless
        stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all Personal Information that we have about you. The
        date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the bottom of this document. We recommend that you
        print a copy of this Privacy Policy for your reference and revisit this policy from time to time to ensure you
        are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Website signifies your acceptance of any changes.
        Access and Accuracy: You have the right to access the Personal Information we hold about you in order to verify
        the Personal Information we have collected in respect to you and to have a general account of our uses of that
        information. Upon receipt of your written request, we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information
        although in certain limited circumstances, we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you
        such as where that information also pertains to another user. In such circumstances we will provide reasons for
        the denial to you upon request. We will endeavor to deal with all requests for access and modifications in a
        timely manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will make every reasonable effort to keep your Personal Information accurate and up-to-date, and we will
        provide you with mechanisms to update, correct, delete or add to your Personal Information as appropriate. As
        appropriate, this amended Personal Information will be transmitted to those parties to which we are permitted to
        disclose your information. Having accurate Personal Information about you enables us to give you the best
        possible service.
